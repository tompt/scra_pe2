Preferential Heating of Oxygen 5+ Ions by Finite-Amplitude Oblique Alfven Waves|Abstract: Minor ions in the fast solar wind are known to have higher temperatures and to flow faster than protons in the interplanetary space. In this study we combine previous research on parametric instability theory and 2.5D hybrid simulations to study the onset of preferential heating of Oxygen 5+ ions by large-scale finite-amplitude Alfven waves in the collisionless fast solar wind. We consider initially non-drifting isotropic multi-species plasma, consisting of isothermal massless fluid electrons...|1500325142857
The ASTRO-H SXT Performance to the Large Off-Set Angles|Abstract: The X-ray astronomy satellite ASTRO-H, which is the 6th Japanese X-ray astronomy satellite and is renamed Hitomi after launch, is designed to observe celestial X-ray objects in a wide energy band from a few hundred eV to 600 keV. The Soft X-ray Telescopes (SXTs) onboard ASTRO-H play a role of collecting and imaging X-rays up to approximately 12 keV. Although the field of view of the SXT is approximately 15' (FWHM), due to the thin-foil-nested Wolter-I type optics adopted in the SXTs, X-rays o...|1500325142857
Performance of ASTRO-H Hard X-Ray Telescope (HXT)|Abstract: The Japanese X-ray Astronomy Satellite, Hitomi (ASTRO-H) carries hard X-ray imaging system, covering the energy band from 5 keV to 80 keV.

After Doppler shift, some of the waves have frequency and polarizatio...|1500325142857
The Merging Galaxy Cluster A520 - A Broken-Up Cool Core, A Dark Subcluster, and an X-Ray Channel|Abstract: We present results from a deep Chandra X-ray observation of a merging galaxy cluster A520. A high-resolution gas temperature map reveals a long trail of dense, cool clumpsapparently the fragments of a cool core that has been stripped from the infalling subcluster by ram pressure. The clumps should still be connected by the stretched magnetic field lines. The observed temperature variations imply that thermal conductivity is suppressed by a factor greater than 100 across the presumed direction...|1500325142857
Radial Profile of the 3.5 kev Line Out to R200 in the Perseus Cluster|Abstract: The recent discovery of the unidentified emission line at 3.5 keV in galaxies and clusters has attracted great interest from the community. As the origin of the line remains uncertain, we study the surface brightness distribution of the line in the Perseus cluster since that information can be used to identify its origin. We examine the flux distribution of the 3.5 keV line in the deep Suzaku observations of the Perseus cluster in detail. The 3.5 keV line is observed in three concentric annul...|1500325142857
Spiral Structure and Differential Dust Size Distribution in the LkH(alpha) 330 Disk|Abstract: Dust trapping accelerates the coagulation of dust particles, and, thus, it represents an initial step toward the formation of planetesimals. We report H-band (1.6 microns) linear polarimetric observations and 0.87 mm interferometric continuum observations toward a transitional disk around LkH(alpha) 330. As a result, a pair of spiral arms were detected in the H-band emission, and an asymmetric (potentially arm-like) structure was detected in the 0.87 mm continuum emission. We discuss the orig...|1500325142857
A Comprehensive Radial Velocity Error Budget for Next Generation Doppler Spectrometers|Abstract: We describe a detailed radial velocity error budget for the NASA-NSF Extreme Precision Doppler Spectrometer instrument concept NEID (NN-explore Exoplanet Investigations with Doppler spectroscopy).

Imaging Analysis of the Hard X-Ray Telescope ProtoEXIST2 and New Techniques for High-Resolution Coded-Aperture Telescopes|Abstract: Wide-field (greater than or approximately equal to 100 degrees squared) hard X-ray coded-aperture telescopes with high angular resolution (greater than or approximately equal to 2 minutes) will enable a wide range of time domain astrophysics. For instance, transient sources such as gamma-ray bursts can be precisely localized without the assistance of secondary focusing X-ray telescopes to enable rapid followup studies. On the other hand, high angular resolution in coded-aperture imaging intro...|1500325142857
The Weak Fe Fluorescence Line and Long-Term X-Ray Evolution of the Compton-Thick Active Galactic Nucleus in NGC7674|Abstract: We present NuSTAR X-ray observations of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in NGC7674.The source shows a flat X-ray spectrum, suggesting that it is obscured by Compton-thick gas columns. Based upon long-term flux dimming, previous work suggested the alternate possibility that the source is a recently switched-off AGN with the observed X-rays being the lagged echo from the torus. Our high-quality data show the source to be reflection-dominated in hard X-rays, but with a relatively weak neutral ...|1500325142857
On the Early-Time Excess Emission in Hydrogen-Poor Superluminous Supernovae|Abstract: We present the light curves of the hydrogen-poor super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe I) PTF 12dam and iPTF 13dcc, discovered by the (intermediate) Palomar Transient Factory. Both show excess emission at early times and a slowly declining light curve at late times. The early bump in PTF 12dam is very similar in duration (approximately 10 days) and brightness relative to the main peak (23 mag fainter) compared to that observed in other SLSNe I. In contrast, the long-duration (greater than 30 days)...|1500325142857
M31N 2008-12a-The Remarkable Recurrent Nova in M31-Panchromatic Observations of the 2015 Eruption|Abstract: The Andromeda Galaxy recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a had been observed in eruption 10 times, including yearly eruptions from 2008 to 2014. With a measured recurrence period of Prec = 351+/-13 days (we believe the true value to be half of this) and a white dwarf very close to the Chandrasekhar limit, M31N 2008-12a has become the leading pre-explosion supernova type Ia progenitor candidate. Following multi-wavelength follow-up observations of the 2013 and 2014 eruptions, we initiated a campaign to...|1500325142857
The X-Ray Reflection Spectrum of the Radio-Loud Quasar 4C 74.26|Abstract: The relativistic jets created by some active galactic nuclei are important agents of AGN feedback. In spite of this, our understanding of what produces these jets is still incomplete. X-ray observations, which can probe the processes operating in the central regions in the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole, the presumed jet launching point, are potentially particularly valuable in illuminating the jet formation process. Here, we present the hard X-ray NuSTAR observations of th...|1500325142857
Herschel Extreme Lensing Line Observations: [CII] Variations in Galaxies at Redshifts z=1-3*|Abstract: We observed the [C II] line in 15 lensed galaxies at redshifts 1 less than z less than 3 using HIFI on the Herschel Space Observatory and detected 14/15 galaxies at 3sigma or better. High magnifications enable even modestly luminous galaxies to be detected in [C II] with Herschel. The [C II] luminosity in this sample ranges from 8 × 10(exp 7) solar luminosity to 3.7 × 10(exp 9) solar luminosity (after correcting for magnification), confirming that [C II] is a strong tracer of the ISM at high ...|1500325142857

An Alternative Time Metric to Modified Tau for Unmanned Aircraft System Detect And Avoid|Abstract: A new horizontal time metric, Time to Protected Zone, is proposed for use in the Detect and Avoid (DAA) Systems equipped by unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). This time metric has three advantages over the currently adopted time metric, modified tau: it corresponds to a physical event, it is linear with time, and it can be directly used to prioritize intruding aircraft. The protected zone defines an area around the UAS that can be a function of each intruding aircraft's surveillance measurement...|1500325142857

Scattering of Gaussian Beams by Disordered Particulate Media|Abstract: A frequently observed characteristic of electromagnetic scattering by a disordered particulate medium is the absence of pronounced speckles in angular patterns of the scattered light. It is known that such diffuse speckle-free scattering patterns can be caused by averaging over randomly changing particle positions and/or over a finite spectral range. To get further insight into the possible physical causes of the absence of speckles, we use the numerically exact superposition T-matrix solver ...|1500325142857

Tropospheric Ozone Change from 1980 to 2010 Dominated by Equatorward Redistribution of Emissions|Abstract: Ozone is an important air pollutant at the surface, and the third most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas in the troposphere. Since 1980, anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors methane, non-methane volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx) have shifted from developed to developing regions. Emissions have thereby been redistributed equatorwards, where they are expected to have a stronger effect on the tropospheric ozone burden due to greater convection, rea...|1500325142857

The Role of Magnetic Helicity in Structuring the Solar Corona|Abstract: Two of the most widely observed and striking features of the Suns magnetic field are coronal loops, which are smooth and laminar, and prominences or filaments, which are strongly sheared. Loops are puzzling because they show little evidence of tangling or braiding, at least on the quiet Sun, despite the chaotic nature of the solar surface convection. Prominences are mysterious because the origin of their underlying magnetic structure filament channels is poorly understood at best. These two t...|1500325142857

Tones Encountered with a Coannular Nozzle and a Method for their Suppression|Abstract: With multi-stream coannular nozzles, sometimes tones occur that may cause the nozzle to fail noise regulation standards. A two-stream nozzle was studied experimentally and numerically in an at-tempt to identify the sources of such tones and explore remedies. For the given nozzle configuration, sharp tones occurred in a range of low jet Mach numbers. The tones apparently occurred due to a coupling between vortex shedding from the struts, which held the nozzles and the center-body together, wit...|1500325142857

Boundary Condition Study for the Juncture Flow Experiment in the NASA Langley 14x22-Foot Subsonic Wind Tunnel|Abstract: Because future wind tunnel tests associated with the NASA Juncture Flow project are being designed for the purpose of CFD validation, considerable effort is going into the characterization of the wind tunnel boundary conditions, particularly at inflow. This is important not only because wind tunnel flowfield nonuniformities can play a role in integrated testing uncertainties, but also because the better the boundary conditions are known, the better CFD can accurately represent the experiment....|1500325142857
Time Resolved Stereo Particle Image Velocimetry Measurements of the Instabilities Downstream of a Backward-Facing Step in a Swept-Wing Boundary Layer|Abstract: Time-resolved particle image velocimetry (TRPIV) measurements are performed down-stream of a swept backward-facing step, with a height of 49% of the boundary-layer thickness. The results agree well qualitatively with previously reported hotwire measurements, though the amplitudes of the fluctuating components measured using TRPIV are higher. Nonetheless, the low-amplitude instabilities in the flow are fairly well resolved using TR- PIV. Proper orthogonal decomposition is used to study the dev...|1500325142857

Coatings for Oxidation and Hot Corrosion Protection of Disk Alloys|Abstract: Increasing temperatures in aero gas turbines is resulting in oxidation and hot corrosion attack of turbine disks. Since disks are sensitive to low cycle fatigue (LCF), any environmental attack, and especially hot corrosion pitting, can potentially seriously degrade the life of the disk. Application of metallic coatings are one means of protecting disk alloys from this environmental attack. However, simply the presence of a metallic coating, even without environmental exposure, can degrade the...|1500325142857

Amino Acid Contents of Meteorite Mineral Separates|Abstract: Indigenous amino acids have been found indigenous all 8 carbonaceous chondrite groups. However, the abundances, structural, enantiomeric and isotopic compositions of amino acids differ significantly among meteorites of different groups and petrologic types. This suggests that parent-body conditions (thermal or aqueous alteration), mineralogy, and the preservation of amino acids are linked. Previously, elucidating specific relationships between amino acids and mineralogy was not possible becau...|1500325142857
Chiral Selectivity as a Bridge to Homochirality|Abstract: In abiotic reactions, equal mixtures of L- and D- amino acid enantiomers are produced unless conditions that favor one enantiomer over the other are present. Understanding how the transition from racemic, abiotic chemistry to homochiral polymers used in proteins occurred is fundamental to our understanding of the origins of life on Earth and the search for signs of life elsewhere, but this transition is still poorly understood. We have begun investigations into whether enantiopure amino acid ...|1500325142857
Volatile Content of 4-Vesta: Evidence from Unequilibrated Eucrites|Abstract: Eucrites are a class of basaltic meteorites that, along with the howardites and diogenites, likely derive from the asteroid 4-Vesta. This asteroid is depleted in moderately volatile elements relative to the Earth and carbonaceous chondrites. Extrapolation of this depletion trend predicts that bulk silicate 4-Vesta (BSV) contains at most 250-1000 µg/g H2O, which is approximately a factor of two lower than the H2O content of Earth. To obtain more accurate H2O and F estimates for BSV, we examine...|1500325142857

Oxygen Buffering in High Pressure Solid Media Assemblies: New Approach Enabling Study of fO2 from IW-4 to IW+4.5|Abstract: Oxygen fugacity is an intensive parameter that controls some fundamental chemical and physical properties in planetary materials. In terrestrial magmas high fO2 promotes magnetite stability and low fO2 causes Fe-enrichment due to magnetite suppression. In lunar and asteroidal basalts, low fO2 can allow metal to be stable. Experimental studies will therefore be most useful if they are done at a specific and relevant fO2 for the samples under consideration. Control of fO2 in the solid media app...|1500325142857
EVA Swab Tool to Support Planetary Protection and Astrobiology Evaluations|Abstract: When we send humans to search for life on other planets, we'll need to know what we brought with us versus what may already be there.

Microbial sample collection outside of a pressurized spacecraft is complicated by temperature extremes, low pressures that preclude the use of laborator...|1500325142857
Oblate-Earth Effects on the Calculation of Ec During Spacecraft Reentry|Abstract: The bulge in the Earth at its equator has been shown to lead to a clustering of natural decays biased to occur towards the equator and away from the orbit's extreme latitudes. Such clustering must be considered when predicting the Expectation of Casualty (Ec) during a natural decay, because of the corresponding clustering of the human population in the lower latitudes. This study expands upon prior work, and formalizes in a single empirical equation the correction that must be made to the cal...|1500325142857
